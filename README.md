Yet another micro MVC-Framework for PHP

This is a try to get a full flexible, dependency injection based and performing MVC-Mirco-Framework. It is created while
taking in concern the rules of Robert C. Martin's Clean Code. As soon as concepts getting clearer it will turn from a
test-supporting project to a test-driven-developed project (in order to train my skills).
Any suggestions and/or constructive critics are welcome.

ToDo-List:
----------
- implement a request factory generating a http request object
- implement an abstract controller
- implement a http response with setting headers and echo to render
- create a hello world example
- add module handling to bootstrap
- add a session module
- add cookie support incl. crypting
- add abstract template engine adapter
- add a twig template engine module
- add composer support
- add validator module
- add cache support
- add hook support
- add logging module

tbd...
